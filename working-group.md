The center of OSPO++ is our working group - a biweekly, recurring meeting where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.


Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

### When:

We meet twice monthly on Thursdays (usually). Depending on whether the topic is based on 'Universities and Academia' or 'Cities and Governments'.

Zoom. While we'd like to use an open source platform, we find that this works best for the our needs.

  - University OSPOs
  - Research Center OSPOs
  - National & Regional Government OSPOs
  - Government Department or Agency OSPO
