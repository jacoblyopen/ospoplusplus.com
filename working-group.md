The center of OSPO++ is our working group - a biweekly, recurring meeting where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.


Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

### When:

We meet biweekly on Thursdays. Depending on whether the topic is based on Universities or Cities, we have an earlier or a later session. The main track is always in the first thirty minutes, followed by a community track for the remainder of the hour.
