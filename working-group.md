The center of OSPO++ is our working groups - recurring meetings where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.

Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

Today, we have four different major working groups, focusing on:

- Universities and higher education institutions
- Cities and governments
- US Open Source policy
- The European Open Source network

We post about how to join on our mailing list.

### When:

- The US Open Source Policy group has a different schedule; [learn more here](/policyroundtable).

- The EU OSS network meets quarterly, in person, at a different European host city. Get in touch to learn more.

- 'Universities and Academia' and 'Cities and Governments' each meet generally meets once monthly on Thursdays.
