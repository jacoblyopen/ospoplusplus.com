The center of OSPO++ is our working group - a biweekly, recurring meeting where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.


Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

### When:

We meet twice monthly on Thursdays (usually). Depending on whether the topic is based on 'Universities and Academia' or 'Cities and Governments'.

## November 2:  Universities & Academia

More information coming soon.

## November 8:  Governments & Agencies

More information coming soon.

### Where:

Zoom. While we'd like to use an open source platform, we find that this works best for the our needs.

### Rules:

We follow both [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) and the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

### Who:

Those that currently run OSPOs, inside champions looking to build an OSPO in their organization, and anyone else seeking to be part of this conversation.

### Types of OSPOs:

  - University OSPOs
  - Research Center OSPOs
  - National & Regional Government OSPOs
  - Government Department or Agency OSPO
  - City and Public Administration OSPOs
  - Philanthropic Funding & Policy Foundations (private & public)
  - Global NGOs
