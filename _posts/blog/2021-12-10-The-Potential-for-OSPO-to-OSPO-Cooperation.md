A Case Study Exploration Of The Potential for OSPO++ to OSPO++ Cooperation.

OSPO++ was honored to host a very special global event on Institutionalizing Open Source, and our shared cooperation infrastructure.
The event was held live, on November 8th 2021, from Hôtel de Ville (Paris City Hall).
It was a hybrid, in-person and virtual event, with speakers and discussion from around the world.  
The event was part of the third Paris Open Source Global Forum, held in-person throughout the day.

We at OSPO++, thank our partners City of Paris, Johns Hopkins University, and The St Francis Neighborhood Center of Baltimore for their leadership on Open Source, both the point of view of the noun (IP/License) and the verb (Communities of people).

### Open Source is about all the boats rising.


As a waxing tide tends to lift all boats equally, Open Source should create a benefit for all, even those who don’t contribute. Even those who are using the software in unintended ways. Even your competitors, even your enemies. Sticking with the boat metaphor, not every boat in the harbor will take advantage of the benefit. Some will rest at anchor. Others won’t be fit to sail. These are not your concerns.


What is your concern is making sure your actual constituents realize and take full advantage of the opportunities opened through involvement in Open Source. Also your concern is growing and strengthening the active part of your community by fostering nurturing culture, acknowledging healthy enlightened self-interest, and delineating intrinsic rewards that are gained by participation and contribution.

### Sovereignty is incompatible with Open Source


And sadly still, some companies, some governments, and many activists continue to try to construe Open Source as a fungible concept that can be modified to create strategic exclusion. Sovereignty is defined as “supreme power or authority”. The idea of “Digital Sovereignty” as in creating an island of benefit for a select group (be they citizens, team members, or any identified group) is fundamentally antithetical to Open Source, since a true Open Source project is by design not an exclusion engine.

### Create more value than you monetize

Tim O’Reilly, whose writings and conferences arguably popularized the Open Source movement, tells us that “the secret to happiness is to create more value than you capture”, and thus intrinsic generosity is also part of the “All Boats Must Rise” philosophy. Supporting the community means leaving opportunities of benefit (and influence) open, and continually giving back commensurate with the value you’ve derived.

Open Source was founded on enlightened self interest, enthusiasm, and collective participation, and I have witnessed that it can create global change, and may be the best chance we have to combat the current global trend towards exclusion and self-protection (which lead quite directly to polarization and excessive nationalism), but only if we lead with the “All Boats Must Rise” nature of this movement.
